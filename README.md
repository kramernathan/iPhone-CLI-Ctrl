# iPhone-CLI-Ctrl

This script implements actions setup via Activator, a package from Cydia designed by Jay Freeman.

On your jailbroken iPhone, open Activator and build actions that will run when a particular keyword is recieved in a text message.
You will also need to correctly configure your ssmtp.conf file, in order to use the mail client implimented in this script.
